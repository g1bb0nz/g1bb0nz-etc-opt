This repository contains various configuration files and snippets I use working on/with Linux
systems.

I'm working primarily with [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/server) latest LTS version on `amd64`
architecture, and the content here reflects this. This means that everything here should work on
instances of that type of system, and in many cases it will work - without or with some
modifications - on other systems/architectures as well.
